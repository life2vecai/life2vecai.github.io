       <h1>Life2vec death calculator offers an AI-powered way to learn when you will die</h1><br>	
       <p>Life2vec AI death calculator, a Black Mirror-like creation by researchers from Denmark and the United States, transcends the boundaries of artificial intelligence, unraveling the intricate tapestry of human existence with a 78% accuracy in predicting life expectancy.<br>

Life2vec is here to stir up some existential vibes, maybe a few laughs, and some futurist thoughts as we grapple with the weirdness of knowing our expiration dates.</p><br><br>
      </div>


      <div class="two">
      	<h2>What is Life2vec AI death calculator, and how does it work?</h2><br>
      	<p>Life2vec is an innovative artificial intelligence (AI) death calculator developed by a team of researchers from Denmark and the United States. The AI system utilizes advanced transformer models, similar to those powering ChatGPT, to analyze and understand the sequences of events that make up an individual’s life. Unlike its more casual counterparts, the Life2vec AI death calculator is designed to predict life expectancy with an astonishing 78% accuracy, according to the report.<br><br>

How is this possible? The study’s lead author, Sune Lehmann, explains that Life2vec approaches the prediction of human lives by representing each person as a sequence of events in their life. These events include crucial details such as income, profession, residence, and health history. By examining these specifics, the algorithm generates predictions about how long a person is likely to live.</p>

      <div class="three">
      	 
      	 <h2>HISTORY OF life2vec death calculator</h2><BR><BR>

      	 <p>Scientists have invented an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that can predict when you will die with 78% accuracy.</p><br><br>

      	 <ol>
      	 	<li>The model was created by scientists in Denmark and the US, who fed data from Danish health and demographic records for six million people into the model. Like ChatGPT, it learned to predict what would come next based on the words before it.</li><br>
      	 	<li>Previous research has already determined that certain life factors can lead to longer or shorter lives. For instance, being male, a smoker or a poor mental health diagnosis can all contribute to shorter lifespans. Higher incomes and having a leadership role can lead to a longer life.</li><br>
      	 	<li>Each of these factors has a code in the Danish data set, such as S52 for a broken forearm, or IND4726 for working in a tobacco shop, which the team converted into words.</li><br>
      	 	<li>This enabled people’s lives to be summed up in data-rich sentences, including things like profession, income, injuries and pregnancy history. </li><br>
      	 	<li>‘In September 2012, Francisco received twenty thousand Danish kroner as a guard at a castle in Elsinore’ and ‘During her third year at secondary boarding school, Hermione followed five elective classes’ are examples of the stories written about subjects.</li><br>
      	 	<li>The AI, a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT and Google’s Bard, then fits all of these words together like a jigsaw puzzle to determine how long the person will live.</li><br>
      	 	<li>The team tested Life2vec on a group of people aged between 35 and 65, half of whom died between 2016 and 2020.</li><br>
      	 	<li>It was also able to predict the results of personality tests more accurately than models specifically trained for the task</li><br><br>

      	<h1>Warning on AI intelligence </h1><br><br>

      	<ul>
      		<li>With obvious ethical concerns about how such AI technology could be used, Lehman outlined that it should not be used by insurance companies.</li><br>
      		<li>Clearly, our model should not be used by an insurance company, because the whole idea of insurance is that, by sharing the lack of knowledge of who is going to be the unlucky person struck by some incident, or death, or losing your backpack, we can kind of share this burden,” he said.</li><br>
      		<li>These findings and the ethical considerations play into fears of the capability of AI and why safeguards need to be in place.</li><br>
      		<li>In recent days, OpenAI introduced a new governance model for AI safety oversight whilst the EU has already reached a deal on significant regulations. The USA has also taken its first steps on AI guidance.</li>
